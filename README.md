# Budget Tracker
This is my Budget Tracker, a practical tool designed for standard budgeting needs and purposes.

## Technologies Used
This project was made with React.JS

## User Story
As someone interested in personal finance, I want to have a tool that creates budgets so that I may track my expenditures and stick to my financial goals.

## My Approach
I approached this project by first mapping out how I wanted it to be structured, and identifying the essential parts. Every budgeting tool needs to have:
- A section where users can input their monetary limit 
- The ability to list what items and services will take away from their budget
- A tracker that shows the remaining balance

With those things in mind, I organized my project, drafted the interface using a [Wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/hWXRm3), and created a set of tasks that would satisfy a functional application.


## Unsolved Problems
A few things I need to address are:
- Users can't delete an Expense Item once it has been populated to the DOM
- There is no local storage so that a user may come back to their initial budget tracker
- The user can only create one budget at a time, so the app lacks reusability
- There aren't any interesting visuals such as charts or graphs

## Closing Remarks
This project is a great practical tool for everyday use. With more development and additions I believe it has the potential to be a staple for users who are interested in personal finance and productivity.
